Notes: 1) It is used to exchange and store text data, similar to XML.
       2) It has a smaller footprint (as there are less tags) than XML
          and hence quicker to parse.
       3) It was popularized with AJAX / JavaScript, as the parsing is very easy.
       4) JSON syntax rules: 
            * key-value pair data
            * Data separated by comma
            * data enclosed in curly brackets
            * data arrays enclosed in square brackets
</pre>
